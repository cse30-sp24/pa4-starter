 * This file is used to determine if your version of a file is used or the one

 *
 * For each of the 4 files you need to complete and turn in for a grade there is
 * compiled working version of that file in the library libpa4.a
 *
 * So libpa4.a contains: csv.o, setorder.o, splitrow.o, wrtrow.o
 *
 * when a line is commented out in the list below the solution version
 * of that file (from libpa4.a) is used in build the executable  file csv.

 * When you want to test your version of a file, uncomment
 * the line that referes to the file you want to test.
